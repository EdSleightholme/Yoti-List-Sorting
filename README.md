Complete the given single page React application that sorts a list of people by name and by age. Model the implementation after the instructions below.

- The unit tests and component PropTypes document the required props and state for the components.
- The application's initial state displays an empty table where the unsorted list of people records must be rendered.
- Update the appropriate program files to achieve the result (as shown in the screenshots below).
- The Sort by name radio button must sort the list by ascending name.
- The Sort by age radio button must sort the list by descending age (i.e., ascending date).
- The unit tests must pass.

This will be run on node v8.15.1 / npm 6.4.1


To Note 
I had great trouble getting this project to run as the scripts used in package.json (start and test) where broken initially.

If given a infinite amount of time next steps would be 

- More tests to be written 
- Check that tests that currently exist are appropriate and still valid
- Address comments I have made though out the code
- Add a style guide for the code
